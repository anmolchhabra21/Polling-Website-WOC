# Polling-Website-WOC
This is my Polling Website making for WOC 

My work: 
1.A successfully and fully responsive sign-in sign up page for a website by firebase authenitcation and get to landing page of my website And the user can also successfully logout whenever the work is done.
2. Under my homepage website information, a contact page and a create poll page.
3. Under this section, I have managed to be make a copy the website link button, That can successfully copy the Website Url by just a click and then the user can share this link to anyone and he\she can go to the same website by using that link.
4. If the user SignOut and then it shows Not Defined as the username when the user is not signed up on the website.
5. The Poll in the website can realtime show the result in the form of no. of votes given to the option and the percentage of votes it has received from the user in the After Poll Section.
6. The Poll also shows the last time it was having the poll no. meaning that all the data stores inside the firebase realtime-database and it also receives the same when the page reloades. 
7. The colour scheme and other things are all in sync across the website.
